# Bayesian Analysis of ARPAV Time Series on Temperatures

This project implements a **Bayesian analysis** of temperature data collected by **ARPAV** (Agenzia Regionale per la Prevenzione e Protezione Ambientale del Veneto) using R. It was developed as part of the course **Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis**, academic year 2023-2024.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to perform a **Bayesian statistical analysis** on time series temperature data collected from four ARPAV stations in the Veneto region between **1993** and **2021**. 


The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the temperature time series data for analysis.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Applying Bayesian models to identify trends and quantify uncertainties in the temperature data.
- **Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)**: Utilizing ARIMA models to forecast future temperature trends for each station, based on the historical time series data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Comparing temperature trends and forecasted values across the different locations.

The primary focus of this analysis is to understand long-term temperature changes and their patterns using a combination of **advanced Bayesian techniques** and **ARIMA forecasting models**, providing both an in-depth analysis of historical trends and predictions for future temperatures.
