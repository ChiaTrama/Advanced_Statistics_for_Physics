# Bayesian Analysis of ARPAV Time Series on Temperatures

This project implements a **Bayesian analysis** of temperature data collected by **ARPAV** (Agenzia Regionale per la Prevenzione e Protezione Ambientale del Veneto). It was developed as part of the course **Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis**, academic year 2023-2024.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to perform a **Bayesian statistical analysis** on time series temperature data collected from four ARPAV stations in the Veneto region between **1993** and **2021**. Using Bayesian inference, we aim to model temperature trends over time and assess how they differ across regions with varying geographical environments, including mountainous, plain, and coastal areas.

The project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the temperature time series data.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Applying Bayesian models to identify trends and uncertainties in the data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Comparing temperature trends across the different locations.
  
The primary focus of this analysis is to understand long-term temperature changes and their patterns using advanced Bayesian techniques, while also providing an intuitive interpretation of the results.
